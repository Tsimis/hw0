// Turner Simis, homework 0 for 225
//#1) I have read the syallabus.
//#2) In the course shecduale, I noticed that we are going to be looking at big O complexity 
// which was something I found pretty confusing when we briefly look at it in 125 so I am 
// nervous but also excited to revisted that again.
//#3) The only way I can think of to describe objects in computer science is they are like
// variables but with more variables to describe whatever you want. Objects are very versitile 
// and be implemented in many different ways within a program.
